- [New_York_City_Population_By_Neighborhood_Tabulation_Areas.csv](Assets\Data\New_York_City_Population_By_Neighborhood_Tabulation_Areas.csv) was found at [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/New-York-City-Population-By-Neighborhood-Tabulatio/swpk-hqdp/data_preview). A filter of `Year is 2010` was applied to the exported data so we only had the most recent population count.

- [2020_Neighborhood_Tabulation_Areas_(NTAs)](Assets\Data\2020_Neighborhood_Tabulation_Areas_(NTAs).json) was found at [NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/2020-Neighborhood-Tabulation-Areas-NTAs-/9nt8-h7nd/data_preview).
